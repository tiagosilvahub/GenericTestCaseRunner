# GenericTestCaseRunner
Generic test case runner for programming challenges. For every test case and every solution, tests the result vs the expected result.

For every failed test you get what was expected and what your solution gave as output. Counts tests failed, tests passed and % of tests passed.

Clone, add your test cases and your solution, change the variable types, run and test your solution in a few minutes.
